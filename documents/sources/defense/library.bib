@article{Freeman1982a,
abstract = {1. A mechanoreceptor model, developed in the preceding paper (Freeman \& Johnson, 1982), was used to study the effects of vibratory intensity and frequency on the responses of slowly adapting, rapidly adapting and Pacinian afferents in monkey hairless skin. As in the previous paper almost all of the response properties studied here were accounted for by the equivalent circuit model; changes in membrane time constant and amplitude sensitivity accounted for the differences between the three mechanoreceptive fibre types.2. The stimulus-response function of primary concern was the relationship between impulse rate and vibratory amplitude. This relationship had the same general form in each of the three fibre types. Amplitudes, I, less than I(0) produced no impulse on any stimulus cycles. Amplitudes greater than I(1) produced one impulse on every cycle. As I rose from I(0) to I(1) the impulse rate rose monotonically from 0 to 1 impulse/cycle. For each fibre type the form of this ramp depended on the stimulus frequency.3. At stimulus frequencies low in the frequency range of each fibre type the (I(0), I(1)) ramp tended to be steep and sigmoidal in shape. Two or more impulses occurred on some cycles and none on others.4. At intermediate frequencies the (I(0), I(1)) ramps became linear with at most one impulse on each cycle. A short plateau appeared at 0.5 impulses/cycle (i.e. there was a range of intensities yielding one impulse on alternate cycles). All of these response properties at low and intermediate frequencies were explained by the model.5. At higher frequencies the (I(0), I(1)) ramps became shallower and developed discontinuities in slope at impulse rates of 0.5 impulses/cycle. At stimulus frequencies greater than 20 Hz for SAs and RAs, the upper segment of the (I(0), I(1)) slope became steeper. For frequencies greater than 80 Hz, the upper segments of the Pacinian (I(0), I(1)) slopes were shallower than the lower segments. These effects suggested transient periods of hyperexcitability following each action potential, and reductions in sensitivity due to high impulse rates, respectively.6. The model's membrane time constant was adjusted to match the observed reduction in the (I(0), I(1)) slope with increasing stimulus frequency. The time constants required for least-squares fitting were 58, 29 and 4.2 msec for slowly adapting, rapidly adapting and Pacinian afferents, respectively; these values are of the same order as those obtained in the preceding paper.7. Receptor sensitivity varied across the frequency spectrum, slow adaptors being most sensitive at low frequencies, rapidly adapting units at mid-range, and Pacinians at the high frequencies. According to the model, the high frequency roll-off in a receptor's tuning curve is due to the current integrating properties of receptor membrane, and the low frequency roll-off is due to a high pass filter, presumably mechanical, situated in the tissues between the stimulus probe and receptor membrane.8. Impulse phase advances with increasing stimulus intensity in both receptor and model. The ability of the model to fit both the rate-intensity function and phase advance functions in individual receptors is demonstrated.},

abstract = {Recordings from single peripheral nerve fibres made it possible to analyse the functional properties of tactile afferent units supplying the glabrous skin of the human hand and to assess directly the relation between impulse discharge and perceptive experiences. The 17,000 tactile units in this skin area of the human hand are of four different types: two fast adapting types, FA I and FA II (formerly RA and PC), and two slowly adapting types, SA I and SA II. The receptive field characteristics and the densities in the skin of the type I units (FA I and SA I) indicate that these account for the detailed spatial resolution that is of paramount importance for the motor skill and the explorative role of the hand. The relationship between the stimulus amplitude and perceived intensity during sustained skin indentations did not match the corresponding stimulus response functions of SA units suggesting non-linear transformations within the central nervous system. These transformations, in turn, appear to vary between subjects. A single impulse in a single FA I unit may be felt when originating from the most important tactile regions of the hand, indicating that the psychophysical detection may be set by the threshold of the sense organs. Moreover, no significant noise seems to be superimposed in the respective central sensory pathways.},

abstract = {Although previous physiological and anatomical experiments have identified four afferent fiber types (PC, RA, SA II, and SA I) in glabrous (nonhairy) skin of the human somatosensory periphery, only three have been shown to mediate tactile (mechanoreceptive) sensation. Psychophysical evidence that four channels (P, NP I, NP II, and NP III) do, indeed, participate in the perceptual process is presented. In a series of experiments involving selective masking of the various channels, modification of the skin-surface temperature, and testing cutaneous sensitivity down to very low-vibratory frequencies, the fourth psychophysical channel (NP III) is defined. Based on these experiments and previous work from our laboratory, it is concluded that the four channels work in conjunction at threshold to create an operating range for the perception of vibration that extends from at least 0.4 to greater than 500 Hz. Each of the four channels appears to mediate specific portions of the overall threshold-frequency characteristic. Selection of appropriate neural-response criteria from previously published physiological data and correlation of their derived frequency characteristics with the four psychophysical channels indicates that each channel has its own physiological substrate: P channel and PC fibers, NP I channel and RA fibers, NP II channel and SA II fibers, and NP III channel and SA I fibers. These channels partially overlap in their absolute sensitivities, making it likely that suprathreshold stimuli may activate two or more of the channels at the same time. Thus the perceptual qualities of touch may be determined by the combined inputs from four channels.},

@article{VanDoren1989,
abstract = {Sensitivities were measured for tangible spatiotemporal sinusoids applied to the index fingertip. The sinusoids had temporal frequencies of 8 and 128 Hz, in order to selectively activate the non-Pacinian I (NP I) and Pacinian (P) cutaneous mechanoreceptor systems, respectively, and had spatial frequencies from 0.00-1.03 cycles/mm. The sensitivity of the NP I system increased as the spatial frequency increased, whereas the sensitivity of the P system generally decreased as the spatial frequency increased. A mechanical model of the fingertip was used to calculate the normal and shear strains in the tissue, and a psychophysical linking hypothesis was introduced to predict tactile sensitivities based on the calculated strains. Specifically, the fingertip was modeled as a slab of a linear, isotropic, homogeneous, viscoelastic material. The boundary conditions were imposed by the spatiotemporal sinusoid at the top of the slab and the rigidly attached bone at the bottom of the slab. It was then assumed that the detection threshold was equal to the stimulus amplitude, which produced a constant, criterion strain at the location of the receptor. For both the P and NP I responses, the agreement between the predicted and measured sensitivities was best for calculations based on the normal strain, and for spatial frequencies below 0.5 cycles/mm. At higher spatial frequencies, the measured sensitivities were higher than predicted. The model also predicted the location of the P and NP I receptors in the tissue, the thickness of the tissue, and the value of the threshold strain for both receptor types. The predicted values agreed reasonably well with independent anatomical and physiological measurements.},

abstract = {In this paper we develop a mathematical model for the electrical activity of the afferent pathway, formed from the coupled primary and secondary sensory neurons. The primary sensory neuron possesses the electrical properties of AH neurons and morphological characteristics of Dogiel type II neurons; the secondary sensory neuron displays the tonic type of electrical behavior and has morphological features of Dogiel type III neurons. Free nerve endings of the mechanoreceptor form the receptive field of the pathway. Based on the general principles of the Hodgkin-Huxley description of excitable cells, the model simulates the following sequence of events: stretch of the receptive field initiates the dendritic potential at the mechanoreceptors; the excitation causes soma action potential development at the primary sensory neuron which is followed by soma action potential generation at the secondary sensory neuron. Numerical calculation have shown that the model is capable of reproducing different electrical patterns within the pathway under normal physiological conditions and after treatment with charybdotoxin, iberiotoxin, tetrodotoxin, omega-conotoxin GVIA, A1-A2 purinoceptor agonists, a protein kinase C activator, and a delta-opioid receptor agonist. Comparison of the computational results with the results of experiments conducted on the neurons of the submucous and myenteric plexi of the small bowel demonstrates their good qualitative and quantitative agreement.},

abstract = {For tactile-haptical feedback in minimally invasive surgery, a tactile actuator array consisting of 8x8 actuators is being built. The system is combined with a tactile optical sensor system mounted in a laparoscopic forceps, providing 8 X 8 signals. These signals have to be shown as a true-scale representation through the actuator array. Therefore each peasured pressure signal is coded into a corresponding actuating displacement. Each actuator is made out of a SMA-spring conditioned with the one way effect. The SMA spring works against a bias spring and both are mounted on an electrically isolated base pin. The bias spring produces a linear rising force against the SMA-spring for resetting the actuator during the passive cooling time. The whole actuator has a diameter of 1.6 mm, a length of 25 mm and is mounted at a distance of 3.2 mm from the next actuator. The resulting force of a single actuator while pressing against the surgeon's fingertip is over 2.5 N, and the actuating displacement is about 3.5 mm. Each pin has analogue adjustment and can be stopped at all positions within these 3 .S mm deflection. The resetting time is about 10 seconds and is reached with 3 fans mounted on three sides of the actuator array. The aim is to build a minimally invasive palpation system so that the surgeon can 'feel' with his laparoscopic forceps.},

Four examples of recent VR projects are described, illustrating the use of haptic feedback in ceramics, aerospace, surgical and defence applications. These examples serve to illustrate the premise that haptic feedback systems have evolved much faster than their visual display counterparts and are, today, delivering impressive peripheral devices that are truly usable by non-specialist users of computing technology.},

abstract = {Of the vertebrate senses, touch is the least understood at the molecular level The ion channels that form the core of the mechanosensory complex and confer touch sensitivity remain unknown. However, the similarity of the brain sodium channel 1 (BNC1) to nematode proteins involved in mechanotransduction indicated that it might be a part of such a mechanosensor. Here we show that disrupting the mouse BNC1 gene markedly reduces the sensitivity of a specific component of mechanosensation: low-threshold rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors. In rodent hairy skin these mechanoreceptors are excited by hair movement. Consistent with this function, we found BNC1 in the lanceolate nerve endings that lie adjacent to and surround the hair follicle. Although BNC1 has been proposed to have a role in pH sensing, the acid-evoked current in cultured sensory neurons and the response of acid-stimulated nociceptors were normal in BNC1 null mice. These data identify the BNC1 channel as essential for the normal detection of light touch and indicate that BNC1 may be a central component of a mechanosensory complex.},

abstract = {As in other excitable cells, the ion channels of sensory receptors produce electrical signals that constitute the cellular response to stimulation. In photoreceptors, olfactory neurons, and some gustatory receptors, these channels essentially report the results of antecedent events in a cascade of chemical reactions. The mechanoelectrical transduction channels of hair cells, by contrast, are coupled directly to the stimulus. As a consequence, the mechanical properties of these channels shape our hearing process from the outset of transduction. Channel gating introduces nonlinearities prominent enough to be measured and even heard. Channels provide a feedback signal that controls the transducer's adaptation to large stimuli. Finally, transduction channels participate in an amplificatory process that sensitizes and sharpens hearing.},

Evidence from more than three decades of combined psychophysical and neurophysiological research supports the idea that each afferent type serves a distinctly different sensory function and that these functions explain most of tactual perceptual function. The available evidence supports the following hypotheses: (1) The slowly adapting type 1 system provides the information on which form and texture perception are based. (2) The cutaneous rapidly adapting system provides information about minute skin motion and, thereby, plays a critical role in grip control. (3) The Pacinian system is responsible for the detection and perception of distant events by vibrations transmitted through objects, probes, and tools held in the hand. (4) The slowly adapting type 2 system provides information for the perception of hand conformation and for the perception of forces acting on the hand. The authors review the evidence on which these hypotheses are based. They also review the role of proprioceptive afferents in the perception of hand conformation because they appear to play a significant role along with cutaneous afferents.},

From hair cells and skin mechanoreceptors in vertebrates, to bristle receptors in flies and touch receptors in worms, mechanically sensitive cells are essential in the life of an organism. The scarcity of these cells and the uniqueness of their transduction mechanisms have conspired to slow molecular characterization of the ensembles that carry out mechanotransduction.

abstract = {I propose a transduction model of the Meissner corpuscle that integrates ideas put forth by Freeman and Johnson and results obtained by Looft. The principal development in the present model is its specification that RA receptor potentials are updated as a linear function of stimulus velocity above baseline; the model thus readily accommodates non-sinusoidal input. It also incorporates modifications to Freeman and Johnson's model proposed by Slav\'{\i}k and Bell, namely a period of refractoriness lasting 1 ms followed by a period of hyperexcitability lasting 13.5 ms. The model is applied to various psychophysical and physiological situations: psychophysical threshold vs. frequency, RA afferent impulse rates vs. intensity, impulse regularity vs. frequency, phase retardation vs. frequency, and responses to non-repeating noise and to complex stimuli. Model output closely matches psychophysical and neurophysiological data. The proposed model thus reliably predicts RA afferent responses to arbitrary stimuli and may facilitate the development of theories relating psychophysical phenomena to their underlying neural representations.},

abstract = {This paper outlines a novel approach of displaying multi- fingered tactile feedback information from remote and vir- tual environments. Miniature tactile fingertip modules are developed allowing multi-fingered integration into an al- ready existing hand force exoskeleton for display of com- bined tactile and kinesthetic feedback. The tactile feedback comprises generation of both, vibrotactile and thermal stim- uli directly at the operator’s fingertip where a multitude of human tactile receptors are located. The proposed parallel configuration of integrated vibration and heat display with combined kinesthetic feedback actuators considers a novel approach towards the generation of holistic haptic sensa- tions. Corresponding tactile rendering algorithms are pre- sented computing realistic tactile stimuli of object proper- ties from either remote real or virtual environments. More- over, the article discusses the design of a developed ther- mal and texture sensor with corresponding data processing algorithms for online identification of tactile object prop- erties in a remote environment. The new quality of gen- erated multi-fingered tactile feedback was evaluated in sev- eral experiments enabling a human operator performing ex- ploratory tasks.},

abstract = {When skin is stretched, stimuli experienced by a cutaneous mechanoreceptor neuron are transmitted to the nerve ending through the skin. In these experiments, we tested the hypothesis that the viscoelastic response of the skin influences the dynamic response of cutaneous rapidly adapting (RA) neurons. Cutaneous RA afferent neurons were recorded in 3 species of mice (Tsk, Pallid, and C57BL6) whose skin has different viscoelastic properties. Isolated samples of skin and nerve were stimulated mechanically with a dynamic stretch stimulus, which followed a pseudo Gaussian waveform with a bandwidth of 0-60 Hz. The mechanical response of the skin was measured as were responses of single RA cutaneous mechanoreceptor neurons. For each neuron, the strength of association between spike responses and the dynamic and static components of stimuli were determined with multiple logistic regression analysis. The viscoelastic material properties of each skin sample were determined indirectly, by creating a nonlinear (Wiener-Volterra) model of the stress-strain relationship, and using the model to predict the complex compliance (i.e., the viscoelastic material properties). The dynamic sensitivity of RA mechanoreceptor neurons in mouse hairy skin was weakly related to the viscoelastic properties of the skin. Loss modulus and phase angle were lower (indicating a decreased viscous component of response) in Tsk and Pallid than in C57BL6 mice. However, RA mechanoreceptor neurons in Tsk and Pallid skin did not differ from those in C57 skin with regard to their sensitivity to the rate of change of stress or to the rate of change of incremental strain energy. They did have a decreased sensitivity to the rate of change of tensile strain. Thus the skin samples with lower dynamic mechanical response contained neurons with a somewhat lower sensitivity to dynamic stimuli.},

abstract = {Rapidly-adapting (RA) mechanoreceptive fibers, which are associated with Meissner corpuscles, mediate one component of the neural information that contributes to the sense of touch. Responses of cat RA fibers subject to 40-Hz sinusoidal stimulation were modeled as a Markov process. Since an RA fiber generates one, two or no spikes in each cycle of the stimulus, the fiber's activity was considered to exist in one of these three possible states. By analyzing empirically generated spike trains, the probability of each state and the probabilities of transitions between the three states were found as a function of the average firing rate of the fiber. The average firing rate depends on the stimulus amplitude. In addition, the phase of each spike with respect to the stimulus cycle was represented by a Laplace distribution. Based on empirical data, the mean and the standard deviation of this distribution decrease as the stimulus amplitude is increased. The entire stochastic model was implemented on a computer to simulate the responses of RA fibers. The post-stimulus time, inter-spike interval and period histograms generated from the simulations match the histograms obtained from the empirical data well as quantified by relative errors. This temporal model can be combined with a population model for average rate to derive a spatio-temporal description of the responses of somatosensory afferents. The effects of changing the stimulation frequency are discussed.},

abstract = {The objective of the study was to characterize the Pacinian representation of stimulus waveform. Subjects were presented with pairs of high-frequency vibrotactile stimuli that varied in intensity and/or frequency content and made same-different judgments under conditions of low-frequency adaptation designed to minimize the contribution of the RA system. We wished to infer the nature of the information conveyed by the Pacinian system about the stimuli from measured sensitivity (d') to stimulus differences. We first tested the hypothesis that the Pacinian system conveys only intensive information about vibratory stimuli and found that intensive cues could not account for much of the variance in the discrimination data. We then proposed a model characterizing the Pacinian-mediated representation of an arbitrary stimulus as a pattern of activation in a set of frequency-tuned minichannels. The model was shown to predict the discriminability of the stimulus pairs presented in the psychophysical experiments. Furthermore, the model parameters, optimized to fit the discrimination data, were compatible with analogous values obtained in other experimental contexts. One of the assumptions underlying the model is that information about individual spectral components is conveyed in parallel and quasi-independently. By simulating the response of a population of Pacinian afferents to a polyharmonic stimulus, we demonstrated that such a population can simultaneously convey information about multiple frequency components, despite having a homogeneous spectral profile.},

abstract = {Subjects were presented with pairs of finely textured stimuli and were instructed to rate their dissimilarity, using free magnitude estimation. The subjects also rated the stimuli along each of four textural continua: roughness, hardness, stickiness, and warmth. In subsequent experimental sessions, we used a Hall effect transducer to measure the vibrations produced in the subjects' fingertip skin as the stimuli were scanned across it. We wished to assess the extent to which the perceptual dissimilarity of the textures could be explained in terms of the perceptual dissimilarity of the vibrations they elicited in the skin. To that end, we invoked a model characterizing the Pacinian representation of a vibratory stimulus. From the model, we computed the difference in the vibratory representations of the two stimuli in each pair. We found that the bulk of the variance in perceived dissimilarity of the textures was accounted for by differences in the Pacinian representations of the vibrations they produced. Our results further suggested that the textural information conveyed by the Pacinian system concerns surface roughness and, possibly, stickiness.},

abstract = {A two-interval forced-choice (2-IFC) tracking procedure was used to evaluate the effects of a 15-s pre-exposure to either 25 Hz or 200 Hz stimulation ("25 Hz or 200 Hz adaptation") on human vibrotactile frequency discrimination threshold (frequency DL/Weber fraction). Three subjects were studied. All stimuli (standard and comparison) were delivered to a central location on the thenar eminence of the hand. The frequency DL/Weber fraction was determined for each subject under the following conditions: (1) no recent prior exposure to vibrotactile stimulation ("unadapted"); (2) after 15 s adaptation to 25 Hz stimulation; and (3) after 15 s adaptation to 200 Hz stimulation. The results demonstrate that the effects of frequency of adaptation on frequency discriminative capacity when the standard stimulus is 25 Hz are not the same as when the standard stimulus is 200 Hz. The differential changes in the capacity of subjects to discriminate frequency of cutaneous flutter (10-50 Hz) or vibratory (>200 Hz) stimulation that occur subsequent to a 15-s exposure of the thenar to 25 Hz or 200 Hz stimulation are proposed to reflect frequency-specific, adaptation-induced modification of the response of contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI and SII) to skin mechanoreceptor afferent drive.},

abstract = {This paper discusses a novel development in estimating the feature of hard lump embedded within a soft tissue with the tactile sensor emulating the major features of a human finger. The aim of this study is to realize precise and quantitative tactile sensing, especially of the stiffness. Since pathology detection is related to tissue stiffness, stiffness measurement would be of great use to provide insight into disease processes and an aid to diagnosis. When pressed into and scanned over tissue of interest with the tactile sensor proposed, the outputs and variance of the outputs of the tactile sensor depends on the mechanical properties and geometric distribution of the structures within the tissue. The features of interest are the stiffness and the depth of the background tissue and the stiffness, size and location of a hard lump emulating the hard tumor. A finite element model was constructed in order to simulate the tactile process. The analysis was performed on models spanning an experimentally determined range of material properties. By analyzing the simulations in groups, we were able to estimate the tendency of the tissue stiffness, location and size information from tactile sensing. Results show the potential of our approach.},

Here, we investigate how the spatial properties of the stimulus shape the afferent response. To that end, we present an analytical framework to characterize SA1 and RA responses to a wide variety of spatial patterns indented into the skin. This framework comprises a model of the tissue deformation produced by any three-dimensional indented spatial pattern, along with an expression that converts the deformation at the receptor site into a neural response. We evaluated 15 candidate variables for the relevant receptor deformation and found that physical quantities closely related to local membrane stretch were most predictive of the observed afferent responses. The main outcome of this study is an accurate working model of SA1 and RA afferent responses to indented spatial patterns.},

In the framework, a tactile display system can apply tactile stimuli to fingers of an operator in syncronization with touch motions based on physical parameters of objects which are estimated by a tactile sensor. To verify the concepts of the framework, was developed a roughness feeling telepresence system which produces vibratory stimuli computed by estimated surface wavelength of objects and rubbing speed of an operator. To implement the framework, real-time estimation of phys- ical parameters of objects are required as core technology. System implementation and real-time estimation of surface wavelength has been also proposed.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a thermal display that assists in object identification in virtual envi- ronments by simulating the thermal cues associated with making contact with materials with different thermal properties. The thermal display was developed based on a semi-infinite body model. Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the perfor- mance of the display. The first experiment compared the ability of subjects’ to identify various materials, which were presented physically or simulated with the thermal display. The second experiment examined the capacity of subjects to discriminate between a real and simulated material based on thermal cues. In the third experiment, the changes in skin temperature that occurred when making contact with real and simulated materials were measured to evaluate how these compare to theoretical predictions. The results indicated that there was no significant difference in material identification and discrimination when subjects were presented with real or simulated materials. The changes in skin temperature were comparable for real and simu- lated materials and were related to the contact coefficient of the material palpated, consistent with the semi-infinite body model. These findings suggest that a thermal display is capable of facilitating object recognition when visual cues are limited.},

abstract = {Tactile telepresence has been expected to be tech- nology which encourages operators of robotic systems to re- motely maneuver objects or recognize materials being touched through robotic arms. In remote environments, temporal dis- parity in tactile sensations is caused by temporal latency between a touch motion of the operator and a tactile stimulus applied on him. A framework of tactile telepresence systems, which is suitable in remote environments, has been proposed in the present paper. In the framework, a tactile display locally generates the tactile stimulus in synchronization with the touch motion of the operator in order to cancel communication delay. The tactile stimulus is generated by combining the motion and tactile factors, which are sensed by a tactile sensor. The factors are characteristic parameters of objects and effect on tactile sensations. In the present paper, physical parameters of the objects are selected as the factors because the tactile stimuli can be computed using physical models involving the motions and the parameters. Based on the proposed framework, a roughness feeling telepresence system was implemented and successfully transferred a roughness factor to the operator.},

An explosion of progress has revealed unanticipated cellular and molecular complexity in these senses. It is now clear that perception of a single stimulus, such as heat, requires several transduction mechanisms. Conversely, a given protein may contribute to multiple senses, such as heat and touch. Recent studies have also led to the surprising insight that skin cells might transduce temperature and touch. To break the code underlying somatosensation, we must therefore understand how the skin's sensory functions are divided among signalling molecules and cell types.},

abstract = {The performance of robotic and prosthetic hands in unstructured environments is severely limited by their having little or no tactile information compared to the rich tactile feedback of the human hand. We are developing a novel, robust tactile sensor array that mimics the mechanical properties and distributed touch receptors of the human fingertip. It consists of a rigid core surrounded by a weakly conductive fluid con- tained within an elastomeric skin. The sensor uses the deformable properties of the finger pad as part of the transduction process. Multiple electrodes are mounted on the surface of the rigid core and connected to impedance-measuring circuitry safely embedded within the core. External forces deform the fluid path around the electrodes, resulting in a distributed pattern of impedance changes containing information about those forces and the objects that applied them. Here we describe means to optimize the dynamic range of individual electrode sensors by texturing the inner surface of the silicone skin. Forces ranging from 0.1 to 30 N produced impedances ranging from 5 to 1000 k. Spatial resolution (below 2 mm) and frequency response (above 50 Hz) appeared to be limited only by the viscoelastic properties of the silicone elastomeric skin.},

abstract = {Thermal cues provide information about the thermal properties of an object held in the hand. These cues can be simulated in a thermal display and used to assist in identifying the object. Two experiments were conducted using a thermal display that simulated the cues associated with contact with different materials. The ther- mal contact model was based on a semi-infinite body model that included thermal contact resistance and blood perfusion. Its performance was evaluated in two ex- periments, the first of which involved discriminating between simulated materials, and in the second, subjects were required to identify simulated materials based on the thermal cues presented to one, three, or five fingers. The results from the first experiment indicated that when the temperature profile associated with contact with a real material is presented to the finger, subjects can use this cue to discrimi- nate between simulated materials. Their performance on this task is comparable to that achieved with real materials with similar thermal properties. In the second ex- periment, the accuracy with which subjects identified a simulated material based on thermal cues improved as the number of fingers stimulated increased, suggesting that spatial summation of cold occurs when the area stimulated is noncontiguous. However, most of the improvement in identifying materials occurred when the dis- play presented thermal cues to three as compared to one finger, with little further enhancement in performance when five fingers were stimulated. These results indi- cate that thermal displays can be used effectively to present information about the material composition of objects in virtual environments.},

abstract = {The objective of this research is to analyze and model the decreases in skin temperature when the hand makes contact with an object at room temperature so that thermal feedback can be incorporated into haptic displays. A thermal model is proposed that predicts the thermal responses of the skin and object surface as well as the heat flux exchanged during hand-object interactions. The model was evaluated by comparing the theoretical predictions of temperature changes to those experimentally measured using an infrared thermal measurement system. The thermal measurement system was designed to overcome the limitations imposed by contact thermal sensors, and was able to measure skin temperature during contact, together with the contact area and contact force. The experimental results indicated that over the pressure range of 0.73-10.98 kPa, changes in skin temperature were well localized to the contact area and were affected by contact pressure. The pressure in turn influenced both thermal contact resistance and blood flow. Over the range of contact forces typically used in manual exploration, blood perfusion and metabolic heat generation do not appear to have a significant effect on the skin's thermal responses. The theoretical predictions and the measured data were consistent in characterizing the time course and amplitude of the skin temperature change during contact with differences typically being less than 1 degrees C between the two for pressures greater than 4 kPa. These findings indicate that the proposed thermal model is able to characterize and predict the skin temperature responses during hand-object interactions and could be used in a thermal display that simulates the properties of different materials.},

abstract = {A tactile feedback system was developed and mounted on the da Vinci robotic surgical system. The system features silicone-based tactile balloon actuators mounted on the robotic master controls, modified commercial piezoresistive sensors mounted on the robotic end effectors, and a pneumatic control system. The system has a frequency response of up to 20 Hz, a linear input force-output pressure relationship, and provides five discrete levels of actuation over a force input range of 0 to 25 N. A demonstration of the system with four subjects grasping a phantom with an embedded pressure-sensitive film suggested that less force was applied with tactile feedback. This paper describes the design, fabrication, characterization, and demonstration of the mounted tactile feedback system and its components. Ongoing studies using the system will assess the benefit of tactile stimuli to learning and control in robotic surgery.},

@article{Boulais2008,
abstract = {The skin is an efficient barrier which protects our bodies from the external environment but it is also an important site for the perception of various stimuli. Sensory neurones of the peripheral nervous system send many primary afferent fibres to the skin. They pass through the dermis and penetrate the basement membrane to innervate epidermal cells or remain as free endings. Nerve fibres are clearly involved in somatosensation. However, they are not always so numerous, for example in distal parts of the limbs, and some kinds of sensors can be at a distance of hundreds of micrometers from each other. The skin can detect patterns at a very fine and smaller scale, which suggests that nerve terminals are helped by epidermal sensors. All epidermal cells (keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells and Merkel cells) express sensor proteins and neuropeptides regulating the neuro-immuno-cutaneous system. Hence, they must play a part in the epidermal sensory system. This review will consider the epidermal components of this forefront sensory system and the stimulations they perceive. The epidermis can be considered a true sensory tissue where sensor proteins and neurone-like properties enable epidermal cells to participate in the skin surface perception through interactions with nerve fibres.},

@article{Belmonte2008,
abstract = {Animals detect environmental changes through sensory neural mechanisms that enable them to differentiate the quality, intensity and temporal characteristics of stimuli. The 'doctrine of specific nervous energies' postulates that the different sensory modalities experienced by humans result of the activation of specific nervous pathways. Identification of functional classes of sensory receptors provided scientific support to the concept that somatosensory modalities (touch, pain, temperature, kinesthesis) are subserved by separate populations of sensory receptor neurons specialized in detecting innocuous and injurious stimuli of different quality (mechanical forces, temperature, chemical compounds). The identification of receptor proteins activated by different physicochemical stimuli, in particular ion channels of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) superfamily, has put forward the concept that specificity of peripheral sensory receptor neurons is determined by their expression of a particular "molecular sensor" that confers to each functional type its selectivity to respond with a discharge of nerve impulses to stimuli of a given quality. Nonetheless, recent experimental data suggest that the various molecular sensors proposed as specific transducer molecules for stimuli of different quality are not as neatly associated with the distinct functional types of sensory receptors as originally proposed. First, many ion channel molecules initially associated to the transduction of only one particular form of energy are also activated by stimuli of different quality, implying a limited degree of specificity in their transducing capacities. Second, molecular sensors associated with a stimulus quality and hence to a sensory receptor type and ultimately to a sensory modality may be concomitantly expressed in sensory receptor neurons functionally defined as specific for another stimulus quality. Finally, activation of voltage gated channels involved primarily in nerve impulse generation can also influence the gating of transducing channels, dramatically modifying their activation profile. Thus, we propose that the capacity exhibited by the different functional types of somatosensory receptor neurons to preferentially detect and encode specific stimuli into a discharge of nerve impulses, appears to result of a characteristic combinatorial expression of different ion channels in each neuronal type that finally determines their transduction and impulse firing properties. Transduction channels don't operate in isolation and their cellular context should also be taken into consideration to fully understand their function. Moreover, the inhomogeneous distribution of transduction and voltage-gated channels at soma, axonal branches and peripheral endings of primary sensory neurons influences the characteristics of the propagated impulse discharge that encodes the properties of the stimulus. Alteration of this concerted operation of ion channels in pathological conditions may underlie the changes in excitability accompanying peripheral sensory neuron injuries.},

abstract = {Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels mediate a wide array of sensory functions. We investigated the role of TRPC5, a poorly characterized channel widely expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system, as a potential osmosensory protein. Here we show that hypoosmotic stimulation activates TRPC5 channels resulting in a large calcium influx. The response to osmotically induced membrane stretch is blocked by GsMTx-4, an inhibitor of stretch activated ion channels. Direct hypoosmotic activation of TRPC5 is independent of phospholipase C function. However, the osmotic response is inhibited in a cell line in which PIP(2) levels are reduced by regulated overexpression of a lipid phosphatase. The response was restored by increasing intracellular PIP(2) levels through the patch pipette. The mechano-sensitivity of the channel was probed in the whole-cell configuration by application of steps of positive pressure through the patch pipette. Pressure-induced membrane stretch also activated TRPC5 channels, suggesting its role as a transducer of osmo-mechanical stimuli. We also demonstrated the expression of TRPC5 in sensory neurones which together with the osmo-mechanical characteristics of TRPC5 channels suggest its putative role in mechanosensory transduction events.},

abstract = {Slowly adapting type I (SA-I) mechanoreceptors encode the edges and curvature of touched objects by generating neural spikes in response to indentation of the skin. Beneath this general input-output relationship, models are of great utility for understanding the sub-processes, as SA-I transduction sites are inaccessible to whole-cell recording. This work develops and validates a SA-I skin-receptor model that combines a finite element model of skin mechanics, a sigmoidal function of transduction, and a leaky integrate-and-fire model of neural dynamics. The model produced a R(2)=0.80 goodness of fit between predicted and observed firing rates for 3 and 5mm grating stimuli. In addition, modulation indices of predicted firing rates for 3 and 5mm gratings are 0.46 and 0.59, respectively, compared to the 0.71 and 0.72 found in vivo. An analysis of predicted first spikes indicates their latency may also be enhanced by edges, as edge proximity shortened first spike latencies by 26.2 and 41.8 ms for the 3 and 5mm gratings, respectively. The model described here bridges the gap between those models that transform sustained indentation to firing rates and those that transform vibration to spike times.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) holds great promise for improving the accuracy and dexterity of a surgeon and minimizing trauma to the patient. However, widespread clinical success with RMIS has been marginal. It is hypothesized that the lack of haptic (force and tactile) feedback presented to the surgeon is a limiting factor. This review explains the technical challenges of creating haptic feedback for robot-assisted surgery and provides recent results that evaluate the effectiveness of haptic feedback in mock surgical tasks. RECENT FINDINGS: Haptic feedback systems for RMIS are still under development and evaluation. Most provide only force feedback, with limited fidelity. The major challenge at this time is sensing forces applied to the patient. A few tactile feedback systems for RMIS have been created, but their practicality for clinical implementation needs to be shown. It is particularly difficult to sense and display spatially distributed tactile information. The cost-benefit ratio for haptic feedback in RMIS has not been established. SUMMARY: The designs of existing commercial RMIS systems are not conducive for force feedback, and creative solutions are needed to create compelling tactile feedback systems. Surgeons, engineers, and neuroscientists should work together to develop effective solutions for haptic feedback in RMIS.},

abstract = {Haptic augmented reality (AR) enables the user to feel a real environment aug- mented with synthetic haptic stimuli. This article addresses two important topics in haptic AR. First, a new taxonomy for haptic AR is established based on a compos- ite visuo-haptic reality-virtuality continuum extended from the conventional contin- uum for visual AR. Previous studies related to haptic AR are reviewed and classified using the composite continuum, and associated research issues are discussed. Sec- ond, the feasibility of haptically modulating the feel of a real object with the aid of virtual force feedback is investigated, with the stiffness as a goal haptic property. All required algorithms for contact detection, stiffness modulation, and force control are developed, and their individual performances are thoroughly evaluated. The resulting haptic AR system is also assessed in a psychophysical experiment, demon- strating its competent perceptual performance for stiffness modulation. To our knowledge, this work is among the first efforts in haptic AR for systematic augmen- tation of real object attributes with virtual forces, and it serves as an initial building block toward a general haptic AR system. Finally, several research issues identified during the feasibility study are introduced, with the aim of eliciting more research interest in this exciting yet unexplored area.},

Through mimicking the layered macro-structure of fingertip skin the sensor is highly conformable and very sensitive, as well as a strong and practical gripping tool. The tactile sensor is composed of a thin flexible rubber skin with structural details emulating those of the glabrous epidermis. This encases a clear, highly compliant polymer melt blend with similar mechanical properties to the dermis and subcutaneous fat. A camera is used to track markers on the internal structural details of the rubber skin enabling remote, detailed, direct and sensitive detection of surface deflections. Initial results presented here show the design to be a very capable, highly sensitive sensor as well as a very practical, affordable and scalable robotic fingertip.},

The in situ measurement of tactile information is a step forward toward restoring the loss of the sense of touch that has occurred due to shift from traditional to minimally invasive surgeries. The sensor was designed such that it can sense low forces which could be comparable to those produced by pulsating delicate arteries, yet can withstand high forces comparable to grasping forces. The influence of some hidden anatomical features, such as lumps, voids, and arteries, on the stress distribution at the grasping surface was studied. In this paper, the capability of the sensor to determine and locate any point load was also investigated.The proposed sensor was designed and manufactured to be highly sensitive, using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The microfabrication procedure of the sensor, including corner com- pensation for toothlike projections and patterning of PVDF film, was discussed. The micromachined sensor was tested, and the experimental results were compared with the results of 3-D finite element modeling. [2007-0286]},

abstract = {The sensation of cold or heat depends on the activation of specific nerve endings in the skin. This involves heat- and cold-sensitive excitatory transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. However, we show here that the mechano-gated and highly temperature-sensitive potassium channels of the TREK/TRAAK family, which normally work as silencers of the excitatory channels, are also implicated. They are important for the definition of temperature thresholds and temperature ranges in which excitation of nociceptor takes place and for the intensity of excitation when it occurs. They are expressed with thermo-TRP channels in sensory neurons. TRAAK and TREK-1 channels control pain produced by mechanical stimulation and both heat and cold pain perception in mice. Expression of TRAAK alone or in association with TREK-1 controls heat responses of both capsaicin-sensitive and capsaicin-insensitive sensory neurons. Together TREK-1 and TRAAK channels are important regulators of nociceptor activation by cold, particularly in the nociceptor population that is not activated by menthol.},

@article{Pawson2009,
abstract = {Pacinian corpuscles (PCs) are tactile receptors composed of a nerve ending (neurite) that is encapsulated by layers of lamellar cells. PCs are classified as primary mechanoreceptors because there is no synapse between the transductive membrane and the site of action-potential generation. These touch receptors respond in a rapidly adapting manner to sustained pressure (indentation or displacement), which until now was believed to be attributable solely to the mechanical properties of the capsule. However, evidence of positive immunoreactivity for GABA receptors on the neurite, as well as evidence for gene expression of synaptobrevin in the lamellar cells led to the hypothesis that GABAergic inhibition originating from the lamellar cells is involved in the rapid adaptation process of PCs. Electrophysiological data from isolated PCs demonstrates that, in the presence of either gabazine or picrotoxin (GABA receptor antagonists), many action potentials appear during the static portion of a sustained indentation stimulus (similar to slowly adapting receptors) and that these "static" spikes completely disappear in the presence of GABA. It was consequently hypothesized that glutamate, released by either the neurite itself or the lamellar cells, caused these action potentials. Indeed, the glutamate receptor blocker kynurenate either decreased or totally eliminated the static spikes. Together, these results suggest that GABA, emanating from the modified Schwann cells of the capsule, inhibits glutamatergic excitation during the static portion of sustained pressure, thus forming a "mechanochemical," rather than purely mechanical, rapid adaptation response. This glial-neuronal interaction is a completely novel finding for the PC.},
