Introduction
	Copying a file is slow
	Why? 9P is RPC, must wait for a response every time
	'fcp' is not the answer
	We frequently read sequentially, but 9P makes us ask specifically each time
[Graphic: the 9P model]
[Graphic: the HTTP model]
Motivation
	We measured HTTP vs. 9P for transferring files
	Used simulated latency
	[tables from paper]
Streams
	When reading sequentially, imitate HTTP
	Send a Tstream, get lots of Rstreams back

Implementation
	Added stream and sread system calls
	Devmnt is sending Tstream messages
	exportfs is replying with Rstream messages
	Kernel is crashing when sread tries to read Rstream messages

set title "15 ms RTT Latency" font "Times-Roman,26"
gnuplot> plot "15ms.txt" using 1:2 title "9P" with linespoints, "15ms.txt" using 1:3 title "HTTP" with linespoints
