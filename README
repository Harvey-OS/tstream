Masters Thesis, Dec. 2010
Topic: "FTP-like Streams for the 9P File Protocol"

This CD-ROM contains materials supplemental to my thesis work.

The documents/ subfolder contains my thesis proposal, defense, and the thesis document itself.

The files in sys/ are meant to be used with Plan 9's divergefs program, to avoid making
changes to the root filesystem. The files under sys/files/ may also be copied to their
corresponding directories in the /sys tree of Plan 9.
